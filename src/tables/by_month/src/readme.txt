The majority of the .txt files contained in this directory were sourced from WHO's
website on Aug 8, 2017. Most of them were housed at
http://www.who.int/childgrowth/standards/en/ while some of the 5-19 year old
charts come from http://www.who.int/growthref/en/.

Additional MUAC data for children over 5 years were compiled by Lazarus Mramba, et al.
See http://www.bmj.com/content/358/bmj.j3423
The data themselves were derived from a PDF from that publication:
